<h1>Privacy Policy – xPredictors</h1>
<p><small>Last updated: October 12, 2025</small></p>

<h2>Who we are</h2>
<p>xPredictors ("the App") is an entertainment application where users can make daily stock price movement predictions (UP/DOWN/FLAT) and view their prediction history, accuracy statistics, and dashboard results.</p>

<h2>What data we collect</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Anonymous Authentication</strong>: Firebase-generated anonymous user ID (no email, phone number, or name is collected).</li>
  <li><strong>Prediction data</strong>: Stock symbols selected, prediction choices (UP/DOWN/FLAT), timestamps, and results.</li>
  <li><strong>User statistics</strong>: Accuracy rate, total number of predictions, credit usage history.</li>
  <li><strong>Device information</strong>: Device type, operating system version (for analytics and app improvements).</li>
  <li><strong>App integrity tokens</strong>: Firebase App Check tokens to verify genuine app usage and prevent fraud.</li>
  <li><strong>Analytics data</strong>: App usage patterns and crash reports for improving the App.</li>
  <li><strong>Advertising data</strong>: Collected automatically by Google AdMob for ad delivery and performance measurement (may include advertising identifiers).</li>
  <li><strong>Purchase data</strong>: In-app purchases (tips/donations) are processed securely by Apple; the App does not receive your full payment information.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How we use data</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Authenticate users anonymously and maintain their prediction history.</li>
  <li>Record predictions, calculate accuracy statistics, and display results on the dashboard.</li>
  <li>Manage the daily credit system (3 free credits + rewarded ad credits).</li>
  <li>Prevent fraudulent activity using App Check and anonymous authentication.</li>
  <li>Improve the App through analytics and crash reports.</li>
  <li>Serve and measure advertising (Google AdMob).</li>
  <li>Process in-app purchases for tips/donations (Apple In-App Purchase).</li>
  <li>Comply with App Store and legal requirements.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Where we store data</h2>
<p>
All user data is stored securely on cloud servers:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Google Firebase Firestore</strong>: Prediction data, user statistics, and credit history.</li>
  <li><strong>Firebase Authentication</strong>: Anonymous user authentication.</li>
  <li><strong>Firebase App Check</strong>: App integrity validation.</li>
  <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong>: Ad delivery and analytics data.</li>
  <li><strong>Apple</strong>: In-app purchase records.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data sharing</h2>
<p>
We do not sell personal data. Data is shared only with trusted third-party service providers as necessary to operate the App:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">Google Firebase</a> (Firestore, Authentication, App Check)</li>
  <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google AdMob</a> (Advertising)</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/">Apple</a> (In-App Purchase, iOS services)</li>
</ul>
<p>
No personally identifiable information (PII) such as name, email, or phone number is collected or shared.
</p>

<h2>Retention</h2>
<p>
Prediction data and statistics are retained as long as the App is in use. Due to anonymous authentication, individual data cannot be identified or selectively deleted. Users can stop data collection by deleting the App from their device.
</p>

<h2>Your choices</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You can limit personalized ads in iOS Settings > Privacy & Security > Tracking.</li>
  <li>You can delete the App at any time to stop all data collection.</li>
  <li>Due to anonymous authentication, we cannot identify or selectively delete individual user data upon request.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Children</h2>
<p>
This App is intended for users aged 13 and above. We do not knowingly collect data from children under 13. If we learn we have collected data from a child under 13, we will promptly delete it.
</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>
We use industry-standard security measures provided by Firebase and Apple to protect user data. However, no method of transmission or storage over the internet is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
</p>
