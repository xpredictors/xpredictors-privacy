<h1>Privacy Policy – xPredictors</h1>
<p><small>Last updated: 2025-10-01</small></p>

<h2>Who we are</h2>
<p>xPredictors (“the App”) is a community-based app where users can make daily stock predictions (closing price and direction) and view aggregated results and statistics.</p>

<h2>What data we collect</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Prediction data</strong>: votes for daily stock predictions (Bull/Bear, price guesses) and optional X (Twitter) handle.</li>
  <li><strong>Device identifiers</strong>: anonymous IDFV and Firebase-generated UID, used to limit abuse and manage votes.</li>
  <li><strong>App integrity tokens</strong>: Firebase App Check tokens to verify genuine app usage and prevent fraud.</li>
  <li><strong>Analytics/Ads data</strong>: collected automatically by Google AdMob for ad delivery and performance measurement (may include device identifiers and cookies).</li>
  <li><strong>Purchase data</strong>: in-app purchases (“tips”) are processed securely by Apple; the App does not receive your full payment information.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How we use data</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Record and count votes, generate leaderboards, and display community statistics.</li>
